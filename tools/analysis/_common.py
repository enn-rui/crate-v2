"""Shared config for Crate's local analysis scripts.

These are the box's analysis programs, vendored to run on ONE computer pointing at a local music
library root. They resolve a single library ROOT and write all sidecars
into ROOT/.crate/ keyed by path RELATIVE TO ROOT (forward slashes) — exactly how the Crate app
(library.py) reads them back, so analysis run on another machine drops straight into the app.

ROOT is always explicit: pass --root so the pipeline never guesses a library.
