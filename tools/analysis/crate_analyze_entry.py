"""crate_analyze_entry.py — PyInstaller entry for the bundled analysis executable (`crate-analyze`).

In the self-contained build the heavy pipeline (torch + MuQ + librosa + umap …) is frozen into its
OWN exe so the GUI process stays light and a crashing analysis step can't take the window down. This
entry is a tiny dispatcher:

    crate-analyze [--root … --limit … --rebuild …]   -> the full pipeline (analyze_all.main)
    crate-analyze --step <module> [args]             -> just that one step's main()

`analyze_all`, when frozen, drives the pipeline by re-invoking THIS exe once per step with `--step`
(so each heavy step runs in its own process and frees its memory afterward — same isolation the
source build gets from per-step `python <step>.py` subprocesses).
