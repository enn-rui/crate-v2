"""cluster.py — assign each track a hard sonic CLUSTER id, computed in FULL 512-d (not off the 2D map).

Reading clusters off a 2D UMAP/PaCMAP projection is unreliable — the projection invents false
neighbours, so unrelated tracks look adjacent. Cluster membership must come from the high-dimensional
space. This runs HDBSCAN over the MEAN-CENTERED 512-d MuQ-MuLan vectors (the same space used for
similarity/mixability) and writes clusters.sqlite (relpath, cluster_id). The Crate app reads it to
COLOR the map by real sonic cluster. cluster_id = -1 means noise / not confidently in any cluster.

Run AFTER embed_muq.py (needs music_vectors.sqlite + its vector_stats mean).

Usage:  python cluster.py [--root DIR] [--min-cluster-size N] [--min-samples N]
